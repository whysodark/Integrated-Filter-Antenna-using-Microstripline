# Integrated-Filter-Antenna-using-Microstripline
Design, fabrication, and measurement of a new compact filter-antenna for modern wireless communication systems 
These are the simulated designs for a theorictically proposed integrated Filter-Antenna for a compact and efficient structure.
The Simulations are done using Ansoft HFSS software. HFSS is high frequency structure simulator it is high performance full wave electromagnetic field simulator 3D volumetric passive device modelling that takes advantages of familiar Microsoft Windows graphical user interface .it integrates simulation, visualization ,solid modelling and automaton in easy to learn environment.
